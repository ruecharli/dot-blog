In recent years, many aspiring worldbuilders have attempted to model realistic plate tectonics for their fictional worlds. The majority of in-depth tutorials use GPlates - a wonderfully scientific program, though hardly designed for worldbuilding. The interface is quite foreign to the average worldbuilder, eating away at time better spent learning more about plate tectonics.

My proposition: Blender. With extensive help from the community, I've taken care of the technical side so that you can focus on pure animation.

Thank you very much to tom_paul, ruuubick, and mereluk on Discord for the help!

**Note:** Once set up, Blender may be used in place of GPlates in most tutorials. I recommend ~20 frames with a step of 50Ma. If you're new to plate tectonics, I thoroughly recommend using a tutorial by Artifexian or Worldbuilding Pasta.

I do hope this is useful, and not too long. Please reply with any questions/feedback. Thanks! :)

Tips/troubleshooting/FAQ:

- "How do I copy a shape and paste it in a new frame?"
-> In the Layout workspace, change from Draw Mode to Edit Mode in the top left. Select the vertices you would like to copy, then press Ctrl + C. Finally, switch to the next frame and press Ctrl + V.

- "How do I rotate an area around the centre of the sphere?"
-> In the Layout workspace, change from Draw Mode to Edit Mode in the top left. Select the vertices you would like to move, then choose the Rotate tool. Finally, find the chain link icon in the upper area of the screen and switch it from Median Point to 3D Cursor. Now, you can rotate the vertices around the centre of the sphere.

- "My exported images appear backwards."
-> Navigate to the Layout workspace, select the Camera object, open Object properties, and make sure Scale X is set to -1.000.

- "How do I switch between perspective/orthographic view?"
-> Use the button with a grid icon. It is on the right side of the 3D Viewport panel, in the Layout workspace. Alternatively, press Numpad 5.
