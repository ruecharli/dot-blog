title: How To Use Blender To Simulate Plate Tectonics

In recent years, many aspiring worldbuilders have attempted to model realistic plate tectonics for their fictional worlds. The majority of in-depth tutorials use GPlates - a wonderfully scientific program, though hardly designed for worldbuilding. The interface is quite foreign to the average worldbuilder, eating away at time better spent learning more about plate tectonics.

My proposition: Blender. With extensive help from the community, I've taken care of the technical side so that you can focus on pure animation.

Thank you very much to tom_paul, ruuubick, and mereluk on Discord for the help!

Note: Once set up, Blender may be used in place of GPlates in most tutorials. I recommend ~20 frames with a step of 50Ma. If you're new to plate tectonics, I thoroughly recommend using a tutorial by Artifexian or Worldbuilding Pasta.
