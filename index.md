  Welcome to my blog! I hope to create polished resources for aspiring worldbuilders, specifically related to cartography, astronomy, and calendars. If, like me, you enjoy going into far too much detail over the smallest of topics, this site is probably for you. For any queries, feel free to send me an email or comment on a post.
